      "text": "You are Codex, a coding agent based on GPT-5. You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\n\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration comes through as direct, factual statements. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nYou avoid cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance, or any kind of fluff. You don't comment on user requests, positively or negatively, unless there is reason for escalation. You don't feel like you need to fill the space with words, you stay concise and communicate what is necessary for user collaboration - not more, not less.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n- Parallelize tool calls whenever possible - especially file reads, such as `cat`, `rg`, `sed`, `ls`, `git show`, `nl`, `wc`. Use `multi_tool_use.parallel` to parallelize tool calls and only this.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- Do not use Python to read/write files when a simple shell command or apply_patch would suffice.\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You have 2 ways of communicating with the users:\n- Share intermediary updates in `commentary` channel. \n- After you have completed all your work, send a message to the `final` channel.\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly.\n\n## Autonomy and persistence\nPersist until the task is fully handled end-to-end within the current turn whenever feasible: do not stop at analysis or partial fixes; carry changes through implementation, verification, and a clear explanation of outcomes unless the user explicitly pauses or redirects you.\n\nUnless the user explicitly asks for a plan, asks a question about the code, is brainstorming potential solutions, or some other intent that makes it clear that code should not be written, assume the user wants you to make code changes or run tools to solve the user's problem. In these cases, it's bad to output your proposed solution in a message, you should go ahead and actually implement the change. If you encounter challenges or blockers, you should attempt to resolve them yourself.\n\n## Formatting rules\n\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis or em dashes unless explicitly instructed.\n\n## Final answer instructions\n\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- Do not begin responses with conversational interjections or meta commentary. Avoid openers such as acknowledgements (“Done —”, “Got it”, “Great question, ”) or framing phrases.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n## Intermediary updates \n\n- Intermediary updates go to the `commentary` channel.\n- User updates are short updates while you are working, they are NOT final answers.\n- You use 1-2 sentence user updates to communicated progress and new information to the user as you are doing work. \n- Do not begin responses with conversational interjections or meta commentary. Avoid openers such as acknowledgements (“Done —”, “Got it”, “Great question, ”) or framing phrases.\n- You provide user updates frequently, every 20s.\n- Before exploring or doing substantial work, you start with a user update acknowledging the request and explaining your first step. You should include your understanding of the user request and explain what you will do. Avoid commenting on the request or using starters such at \"Got it -\" or \"Understood -\" etc.\n- When exploring, e.g. searching, reading files you provide user updates as you go, every 20s, explaining what context you are gathering and what you've learned. Vary your sentence structure when providing these updates to avoid sounding repetitive - in particular, don't start each sentence the same way.\n- After you have sufficient context, and the work is substantial you provide a longer plan (this is the only user update that may be longer than 2 sentences and can contain formatting).\n- Before performing file edits of any kind, you provide updates explaining what edits you are making.\n- As you are thinking, you very frequently provide updates even if not taking any actions, informing the user of your progress. You interrupt your thinking and send multiple updates in a row if thinking for more than 100 words.\n- Tone of your updates MUST match your personality.\n",

Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.\n# Escalation Requests\n\nCommands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pipes: |\n- Logical operators: &&, ||\n- Command separators: ;\n- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)\n\nEach resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.\n\nExample:\n\ngit pull | tee output.txt\n\nThis is treated as two command segments:\n\n[\"git\", \"pull\"]\n\n[\"tee\", \"output.txt\"]\n\n## How to request escalation\n\nIMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n\n- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. \"Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?\"\n- Optionally suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.\n\nIf you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with \"require_escalated\". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` parameter - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n\n## When to request escalation\n\nWhile commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:\n\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n- Be judicious with escalating, but if completing the user's request requires it, you should do so - don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.\n\n## prefix_rule guidance\n\nWhen choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You should rarely pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.\n\n### Banned prefix_rules \nAvoid requesting overly broad prefixes that the user would be ill-advised to approve. For example, do not request [\"python3\"], [\"python\", \"-\"], or other similar prefixes.\nNEVER provide a prefix_rule argument for destructive commands like rm.\nNEVER provide a prefix_rule if your command uses a heredoc or herestring. \n\n### Examples\nGood examples of prefixes:\n- [\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n- [\"gh\", \"pr\", \"check\"]\n- [\"pytest\"]\n- [\"cargo\", \"test\"]\n\n\n## Approved command prefixes\nThe following prefix rules have already been approved: \n The writable roots are `/Users/pascal/Code/business/convx`, `/tmp`, `/var/folders/pq/9xtx3myj0s9068m8w9xxy0wr0000gn/T`.\n</permissions instructions>",

      "text": "<app-context>\n# Codex desktop context\n- You are running inside the Codex (desktop) app, which allows some additional features not available in the CLI alone:\n\n### Images/Visuals/Files\n- In the app, the model can display images using standard Markdown image syntax: ![alt](url)\n- When sending or referencing a local image, always use an absolute filesystem path in the Markdown image tag (e.g., ![alt](/absolute/path.png)); relative paths and plain text will not render the image.\n- When referencing code or workspace files in responses, always use full absolute file paths instead of relative paths.\n- If a user asks about an image, or asks you to create an image, it is often a good idea to show the image to them in your response.\n- Use mermaid diagrams to represent complex diagrams, graphs, or workflows. Use quoted Mermaid node labels when text contains parentheses or punctuation.\n- Return web URLs as Markdown links (e.g., [label](https://example.com)).\n\n### Automations\n- This app supports recurring tasks/automations\n- Automations are stored as TOML in $CODEX_HOME/automations/<id>/automation.toml (not in SQLite). The file contains the automation's setup; run timing state (last/next run) lives in the SQLite automations table.\n\n#### When to use directives\n- Only use ::automation-update{...} when the user explicitly asks for automation, a recurring run, or a repeated task.\n- If the user asks about their automations and you are not proposing a change, do not enumerate names/status/ids in plain text. Fetch/list automations first and emit view-mode directives (mode=\"view\") for those ids; never invent ids.\n- Never return raw RRULE strings in user-facing responses. If the user asks about their automations, respond using automation directives (e.g., with an \"Open\" button if you're not making changes).\n\n#### Directive format\n- Modes: view, suggested update, suggested create. View and suggested update MUST include id; suggested create must omit id.\n- For view directives, id is required and other fields are optional (the UI can load details).\n- For suggested update/create, include name, prompt, rrule, cwds, and status. cwds can be a comma-separated list or a JSON array string.\n- Always come up with a short name for the automation. If the user does not give one, propose a short name and confirm.\n- Default status to ACTIVE unless the user explicitly asks to start paused.\n- Always interpret and schedule times in the user's locale time zone.\n- Directives should be on their own line(s) and be separated by newlines.\n- Do not generate remark directives with multiline attribute values.\n\n#### Prompting guidance\n- Ask in plain language what it should do, when it should run, and which workspaces it should use (if any), then map those answers into name/prompt/rrule/cwds/status for the directive.\n- The automation prompt should describe only the task itself. Do not include schedule or workspace details in the prompt, since those are provided separately.\n- Keep automation prompts self-sufficient because the user may have limited availability to answer questions. If required details are missing, make a reasonable assumption, note it, and proceed; if blocked, report briefly and stop.\n- When helpful, include clear output expectations (file path, format, sections) and gating rules (only if X, skip if exists) to reduce ambiguity.\n- Automations should always open an inbox item.\n  - Archiving rule: only include `::archive-thread{}` when there is nothing actionable for the user.\n  - Safe to archive: \"no findings\" checks (bug scans that found nothing, clean lint runs, monitoring checks with no incidents).\n  - Do not archive: deliverables or follow-ups (briefs, reports, summaries, plans, recommendations).\n  - If you do archive, include the archive directive after the inbox item.\n- Do not instruct them to write a file or announce \"nothing to do\" unless the user explicitly asks for a file or that output.\n- When mentioning skills in automation prompts, use markdown links with a leading dollar sign (example: [$checks](/Users/ambrosino/.codex/skills/checks/SKILL.md)).\n\n#### Scheduling constraints\n- RRULE limitations (to match the UI): only hourly interval schedules (FREQ=HOURLY with INTERVAL hours, optional BYDAY) and weekly schedules (FREQ=WEEKLY with BYDAY plus BYHOUR/BYMINUTE). Avoid monthly/yearly/minutely/secondly, multiple rules, or extra fields; unsupported RRULEs fall back to defaults in the UI.\n\n#### Storage and reading\n- When a user asks for changes to an automation, you may read existing automation TOML files to see what is already set up and prefer proposing updates over creating duplicates.\n- You can read and update automations in $CODEX_HOME/automations/<id>/automation.toml and memory.md only when the user explicitly asks you to modify automations.\n- Otherwise, do not change automation files or schedules.\n- Automations work best with skills, so feel free to propose including skills in the automation prompt, based on the user's context and the available skills.\n\n#### Examples\n- ::automation-update{mode=\"suggested create\" name=\"Daily report\" prompt=\"Summarize Sentry errors\" rrule=\"FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=9;BYMINUTE=0\" cwds=\"/path/one,/path/two\" status=\"ACTIVE\"}\n- ::automation-update{mode=\"suggested update\" id=\"123\" name=\"Daily report\" prompt=\"Summarize Sentry errors\" rrule=\"FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=9;BYMINUTE=0\" cwds=\"/path/one,/path/two\" status=\"ACTIVE\"}\n- ::automation-update{mode=\"view\" id=\"123\"}\n\n### Review findings\n- Use the ::code-comment{...} directive to emit inline code review findings (or when a user asks you to call out specific lines).\n- Emit one directive per finding; emit none when there are no findings.\n- Required attributes: title (short label), body (one-paragraph explanation), file (path to the file).\n- Optional attributes: start, end (1-based line numbers), priority (0-3), confidence (0-1).\n- priority/confidence are for review findings; omit when you're just pointing at a location without a finding.\n- file should be an absolute path or include the workspace folder segment so it can be resolved relative to the workspace.\n- Keep line ranges tight; end defaults to start.\n- Example: ::code-comment{title=\"[P2] Off-by-one\" body=\"Loop iterates past the end when length is 0.\" file=\"/path/to/foo.ts\" start=10 end=11 priority=2 confidence=0.55}\n\n### Archiving\n- If a user specifically asks you to end a thread/conversation, you can return the archive directive ::archive{...} to archive the thread/conversation.\n- Example: ::archive{reason=\"User requested to end conversation\"}\n\n### Git\n- Branch prefix: `pascal-cdx/`. Use this prefix when creating branches; do not create unprefixed branch names.\n- Commit instructions: use conventional commits pls. keep message short, usually just the first line, maybe a few words in the body.\n</app-context>",

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/pascal/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/pascal/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>",

Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.\n Approvals are your mechanism to get user consent to run shell commands without the sandbox. `approval_policy` is `unless-trusted`: The harness will escalate most commands for user approval, apart from a limited allowlist of safe \"read\" commands.\n The writable roots are `/Users/pascal/.codex`, `/tmp`, `/var/folders/pq/9xtx3myj0s9068m8w9xxy0wr0000gn/T`.\n</permissions instructions>\n\n## 2. User\n\n_Timestamp: `2026-02-15T10:55:11.097Z`_\n\n# AGENTS.md instructions for /Users/pascal/.codex\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/pascal/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/pascal/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n\n## 3.

Developer\n\n_Timestamp: `2026-02-15T10:58:03.084Z`_\n\n<collaboration_mode># Collaboration Mode: Default\n\nYou are now in Default mode. Any previous instructions for other modes (e.g. Plan mode) are no longer active.\n\nYour active mode changes only when new developer instructions with a different `<collaboration_mode>...</collaboration_mode>` change it; user requests or tool descriptions do not change mode by themselves. Known mode names are Default and Plan.\n\n## request_user_input availability\n\nThe `request_user_input` tool is unavailable in Default mode. If you call it while in Default mode, it will return an error.\n\nIf a decision is necessary and cannot be discovered from local context, ask the user directly. However, in Default mode you should strongly prefer executing the user's request rather than stopping to ask questions.\n</collaboration_mode>\n\n## 5. User\n\n_Timestamp: `2026-02-15T10:58:03.086Z`_\n\ncan you check the @sessions/ folder and tell me how we can write a simple script that synchronsises these into a git repo for backup pruposes that follows the pattern\n\nroot/\n  history/\n    system-name/\n      original-relative-to-home-path/\n        YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM-slug.md\n        YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM-slug2.md\n\nso a git repo that stores all these converastions but structured around \"where\" they were had, ie. which folder. and then named by date so we can easily go back in time. \n\nI want to be able to really nicely read through them. \nActually let's store tehem 2x. once json once md, that way we can also think of a simple web-interface to \"go back through convos\" easily. But for now let's just keep the json intermediary state as .YYYY-MM-DD....json and then keep the md non hidden. Just make a plan for now for how to build this, inspect the data format etc.\n\n## 6.

Assistant\n\n_Timestamp: `2026-02-15T12:00:55.333Z`_\n\nGreat, I checked it and we can definitely do this cleanly.\n\n**What I Found**\n- `sessions/` is year/month/day with `*.jsonl` session logs (126 files total; dates from 2025-09-26 to 2026-02-15).\n- Every file starts with a `session_meta` line containing stable fields like `payload.cwd`, `payload.id`, `timestamp` (example: `sessions/2026/02/02/rollout-2026-02-02T16-26-03-019c1ef5-fe68-7cd1-98bf-9884a79f407b.jsonl:1`).\n- Main record types are `session_meta`, `turn_context`, `response_item`, `event_msg`; enough to render readable transcripts.\n- No skill was applied since available skills are for skill create/install, not log backup/export.\n\n**Plan**\n- Build `scripts/sync_sessions_backup.py` to scan all `sessions/**/*.jsonl`.\n- For each file: parse first line `session_meta`, derive `system-name` + `original-relative-to-home-path` from `cwd`.\n- Write two outputs per session into backup repo:\n  - hidden JSON: `.YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<slug>.json`\n  - readable markdown: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<slug>.md`\n- Target layout: `history/<system-name>/<relative-path>/...` (exactly your pattern).\n- Slug strategy: first user prompt snippet (sanitized), fallback to session id tail.\n- Add incremental sync via manifest (source file hash/mtime) to avoid rewriting unchanged sessions.\n- Markdown renderer: chronological turns, role headers, tool calls collapsed sections, and separators for easy reading.\n\nIf you want, next I can implement the script + sample output for 3 sessions.\n\n## 15. User\n\n_Timestamp: `2026-02-15T12:02:37.705Z`_\n\nOkay, so this should ideally also be so right now we're just gonna build this for codecs but w we'll also leverage other or we'll also build this for other AI systems. so I think what's what we should expand the folder structure to is one the sessions should be namespaced by users because that way we can bring different user sessions into the repo.\n\nAnd then the second thing is that we should tag or label them somehow with the the source system. So that could be either codex or clawed or Gemini or Open Code or other systems. So that's also something we need to take into consideration. And then the last thing is I'd love this strict to be script to be idempotent so that it only only reprocesses sessions that haven't been stored yet because ideally I want to run this you know maybe on a schedule every day or every hour or something and so that way it should be itempotent and not balloon in complexity or in in runtime.\n\n## 16. Assistant\n\n_Timestamp: `2026-02-15T12:02:58.392Z`_\n\nPerfect — yes, that’s the right evolution.\n\n**Proposed Canonical Layout**\n- `root/history/<user>/<source-system>/<system-name>/<path-relative-to-home>/`\n- Files per session:\n  - `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<slug>.md`\n  - `.YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<slug>.json`\n- Example:\n  - `history/pascal/codex/macbook-pro/Code/everycure/prototypes/matrix-heatmap-test/2026-02-05-1608-heatmap-filtering.md`\n\n**Multi-System Design**\n- Add a normalized session model (`NormalizedSession`) with fields like:\n  - `user`, `source_system`, `source_session_id`, `started_at`, `cwd`, `messages`, `raw_ref`\n- Implement adapters:\n  - `codex_adapter` now\n  - `claude_adapter`, `gemini_adapter`, etc. later\n- Each adapter only maps source format -> normalized format; renderer/writer stays shared.\n",

User\n\n_Timestamp: `2026-02-15T12:09:10.545Z`_\n\nOkay, I've given you access now.\n\n## 25. Assistant\n\n_Timestamp: `2026-02-15T12:10:07.351Z`_\n\nGreat, I’ll now finish the full `exporter/` implementation (CLI + engine + docs + tests), then run `uv sync` and the integration test end-to-end.\n\n## 26. User\n\n_Timestamp: `2026-02-15T12:10:35.276Z`_\n\nOne additional subcommand that I think we should implement is something like a sync or something where you pass in the path to a git repository and then this tool synchronizes all of the history, all the conversations of that Git repository to that Git repository, with potentially a defining a subpath which is the the path inside of that git git repo under which will store all of the conversations.\n\nSo I think the use case is let's say I had a a repository called backend and I wanted to synchronize all of my cloud code and Gemini and whatnot conversations into that very Git repo. Then I would call the CLI and say sync and give it the path to the Git repo and then this tool would extract all of my previous conversations into that very Git repository, but only for that Git repository, right?\n\nNot all of them across all repos, but just the specific one in question. And so that allows you to not back up everything into one place, but to back up only the conversations that are relevant to a specific project into the specific project.\n\n## 27. Assistant\n\n_Timestamp: `2026-02-15T12:10:48.210Z`_\n\nGreat call — I’ll add a dedicated `sync-repo` subcommand that filters sessions to a specific Git repo and supports configurable in-repo subpath, then cover it with integration tests.\n\n## 28. Assistant\n\n_Timestamp: `2026-02-15T12:12:21.798Z`_\n\nI’ve added the core engine and CLI. Next I’ll add fixture-based integration tests (including `sync-repo`) and update docs for the new subcommand.\n\n## 29. Assistant\n\n_Timestamp: `2026-02-15T12:16:40.457Z`_\n\nI’ve finished implementation and tests; I’ll now run `uv sync` and the pytest integration suite to verify end-to-end behavior.\n\n## 30. Assistant\n\n_Timestamp: `2026-02-15T12:16:52.716Z`_\n\nI found the failing edge case: fixture paths are from a different root. I’ll add a repo-name fallback matcher in `sync-repo` so project-scoped sync works across machines too, then rerun tests.\n\n## 31. Assistant\n\n_Timestamp: `2026-02-15T12:17:07.208Z`_\n\nAll done and validated. I’ll quickly grab exact file line references, then send a concise handoff with usage examples.\n\n## 32. Assistant\n\n_Timestamp: `2026-02-15T12:17:23.603Z`_\n\nImplemented — full `uv` + Typer exporter is now in `exporter/`, including your new repo-scoped sync behavior.\n\n**What’s Built**\n- CLI with `sync`, `sync-repo`, `stats` in `exporter/src/conversation_exporter/cli.py:13`\n- Idempotent sync engine + index at `.convx/index.json` in `exporter/src/conversation_exporter/engine.py:20`\n- Codex adapter (default input `~/.codex/sessions`) in `exporter/src/conversation_exporter/adapters/codex.py:10`\n- User-facing docs in `exporter/README.md:1`\n- Developer internals in `exporter/documentation.md:1`\n- `uv` project setup in `exporter/pyproject.toml:1`\n\n**Repo-Scoped Sync**\n- `sync-repo` filters to sessions relevant to one Git repo via `--repo-path`\n- Supports `--history-subpath` so you can place exports anywhere in that repo\n- Cross-machine tolerant: matches by resolved path and repo folder-name fallback (`engine.py:71`)\n\n**Validation**\n- Added integration tests with fixture JSONL data in `exporter/tests/test_integration_sync.py:1`\n- Ran successfully: `cd exporter && uv run pytest -q` → `2 passed`\n",
