      "text": "Now I have a complete picture of the bottlenecks. Let me explain what's actually slow before jumping to solutions:\n\n**Root causes (not what you'd expect):**\n\n1. **`_refresh_list()` is called on every single keystroke** — it calls `lst.clear()` then creates N `ListItem(Label(...))` Textual widgets from scratch every time. For 300 sessions that's ~300 widget instantiations + DOM insertions per keystroke. This is the main killer.\n\n2. **No debouncing** — every keystroke immediately triggers the full search + full list rebuild on the main UI thread, blocking rendering.\n\n3. **Textual's `FuzzySearch` is pure Python** — runs in a loop over all sessions per keystroke.\n\n**The good news:** `tantivy` (already in your stack) is Rust-backed and sub-millisecond. That part is fast. The bottleneck is entirely in the Python TUI layer.\n\n**The fix** — three targeted changes:\n- `rapidfuzz` (C++ backend) to replace Textual's `FuzzySearch`  \n- `@work(exclusive=True)` (Textual's built-in worker system) — starts a new async task per keystroke, auto-cancels the previous one  \n- `await asyncio.sleep(0.08)` as debounce inside the worker, so typing fast skips intermediate searches entirely\n- Pre-compute formatted display strings once at load",

      "text": "All 27 tests pass. Here's a summary of what changed and why each piece matters:\n\n---\n\n**What was slow and why:**\n\n1. **No debouncing** — every keystroke immediately triggered a full search + full DOM rebuild on the main thread. At 300 sessions, that's ~300 Textual widget instantiations blocking rendering.\n\n2. **Textual's `FuzzySearch`** — pure Python loop over all sessions per keystroke.\n\n3. **`_refresh_list()` blocking the UI thread** — `lst.clear()` + 300× `lst.append(ListItem(Label(...)))` ran synchronously, freezing input between keystrokes.\n\n**What changed:**\n\n- **`rapidfuzz.process.extract`** (C++ backend, `WRatio` scorer) replaces Textual's pure-Python `FuzzySearch`. For a few hundred strings it completes in microseconds.\n\n- **`@work(exclusive=True)`** on both `_apply_fuzzy` and `_run_tantivy` — Textual's worker system automatically cancels the previous worker when a new one starts. If you type faster than 80ms per key, intermediate searches are cancelled before they touch the DOM.\n\n- **`await asyncio.sleep(0.08)`** inside the worker — this is the debounce gate. A fast burst of keystrokes cancels and restarts this sleep, so the expensive work only runs when you pause.\n\n- **`run_in_executor`** — the rapidfuzz call and tantivy query run in a thread pool, keeping the Textual event loop free to handle input and render frames.\n\n- **`_formatted` list** — pre-computed once at load, so `_format_session()` isn't called inside the search hot path.\n\nThe search is still the Python TUI as the visible layer — the heavy lifting (fuzzy matching via C++, full-text via Rust/tantivy) now happens off the main thread with proper cancellation.",
