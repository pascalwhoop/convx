Nothing embarrassing or obviously sensitive in the text.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n| Category        | Status |\n|----------------|--------|\n| API keys/tokens| None found |\n| Passwords      | None found |\n| Personal paths | `/Users/pascal/...` in many places |\n| Hostname       | `Pascals-MBP.local` |\n| Other projects | `newcohorts.com` referenced |\n| Embarrassing   | None found |\n\nIf you want to share this publicly, consider:\n\n1. **Path normalization** – Optional feature to replace `/Users/pascal/...` with something like `~` or `$HOME` in exports.\n2. **Project name** – `newcohorts.com` is only in tool output; you can decide if that’s acceptable.\n3. **`.json` files** – They contain more raw data (paths, permissions, tool output). Consider keeping them out of `.git` if you’re worried about path exposure, or add path normalization.",
